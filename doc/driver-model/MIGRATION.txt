Migration Schedule
====================

U-Boot has been migrating to a new driver model since its introduction in
2014. This file describes the schedule for deprecation of pre-driver-model
features.

CONFIG_DM_MMC
-------------

Status: In progress
Deadline: 2019.04

The subsystem itself has been converted and maintainers should submit patches
switching over to using CONFIG_DM_MMC and other base driver model options in
time for inclusion in the 2019.04 rerelease.

CONFIG_DM_USB
-------------

Status: In progress
Deadline: 2019.07

The subsystem itself has been converted along with many of the host controller
and maintainers should submit patches switching over to using CONFIG_DM_USB and
other base driver model options in time for inclusion in the 2019.07 rerelease.

CONFIG_SATA
-----------

Status: In progress
Deadline: 2019.07

The subsystem itself has been converted along with many of the host controller
and maintainers should submit patches switching over to using CONFIG_AHCI and
other base driver model options in time for inclusion in the 2019.07 rerelease.

CONFIG_BLK
----------

Status: In progress
Deadline: 2019.07

In concert with maintainers migrating their block device usage to the
appropriate DM driver, CONFIG_BLK needs to be set as well.  The final deadline
here coincides with the final deadline for migration of the various block
subsystems.

CONFIG_DM_SPI
CONFIG_DM_SPI_FLASH
-------------------

Board Maintainers should submit the patches for enabling DM_SPI and DM_SPI_FLASH
to move the migration with in the deadline.

Status: In progress
Deadline: 2018.09
